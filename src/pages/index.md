This is a space to show my data science coursework/projects and some writing. On this website, you'll find examples of work in statistical analysis, machine learning and data visualization. You'l also find some essays from my time as an IR and politics undergrad. I don't know how good they are, the more I read them, the worse they get.. Please don't hesitate to get in contact and thank you for visiting!
