This page was designed to showcase a range of uni projects to help me get a grad job. It didn't work - but now I'm weirdly sentimental over it. I want to morph it into something else but am unsure as to what. For rants and musings see the blog section - EDIT: had to delete them because of new job, impartiality et cetera et cetera.
