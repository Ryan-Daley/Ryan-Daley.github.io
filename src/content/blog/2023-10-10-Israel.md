"People are telling themselves lies about reality. They are living in a world of fantasy, purporting their fantasy to be reality. They tell lies about other people and they don't realise they are lies as there is no such thing as a lie anymore as there is no such thing as truth. Everything is a matter of opinion, everything is a matter of opinion."

**TL/DR -** *Israel should not be confining those in the Gaza strip to such horrible conditions. The settlements need to not only stop, but be withdrawn from much, if not all, of the West bank. That is, if a two state solution is ever to materialise. However, there is undeniably a security risk posed to Israelis by those in Gaza.*

#### Synopsis of October 7th Attack 
At the time of writing, the number of Israelli's murdered has risen to 800, with 2300 wounded and at least 100 being held hostage in Gaza. Eldery and children slaughtered, women raped, bodies taken into Gaza and paraded and desecrated. A great evil was comitted in Israel this weekend, perpertrated by the Palestinian Arabs and their Iranian backers, but the west has blood on its hands too.

Hundreds of Hamas Gunmen brazenly infiltrated the south of the country, using jeeps and paragliders to overwhelm Israels supposedly sophisitcated border defences. There, Hamas forces attacked some 22 villages and towns along the southern border, all the while thousands of rockets fired from gaza headed to the south and centre of the country. Israelis were murdered at bus stops, in their cars, in their homes, with gunmen going from house to house, killing them and burning their houses down.
