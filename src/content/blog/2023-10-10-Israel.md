"People are telling themselves lies about reality. They are living in a world of fantasy, purporting their fantasy to be reality. They tell lies about other people and they don't realise they are lies as there is no such thing as a lie anymore as there is no such thing as truth. Everything is a matter of opinion, everything is a matter of opinion."

**TL/DR -** *Israel should not be confining those in the Gaza strip to such horrible conditions. The settlements need to not only stop, but be withdrawn from much, if not all, of the West bank. In reality this will almost certainly not happen. However, there is undeniable security risk posed to Israelis by those in Gaza. Hamas aren't simply attacking Israel because of the settlements and they'd just as soon kill every Jewish person if they had the chance to, it's literally part of their creed and the backbone to the foundation of Hamas.*

*It's understandable why those in Palestine would want to fight back. However, and this seems ridiculous to utter, it is not acceptable to capture, torture, rape, murder and defile the corpses of civilians from Israel. Recording yourselves doing it and throwing it into the internet to show off your savagery to the world reveals far more intent than simply "freedom fighting". Anyone cheering on this behaviour or who says this is "revolutionary" are showing their true colors. 80 years ago they would be cheering on Jews being trained off to Auschwitz.*

*The deaths of Palestinians far outnumber the deaths of Israelis, for a variety of reasons, and it's fair to take that into account when weighing up the responsibilities of both sides to end these struggles. But remember, while Israel might dwarf Palestine on its own, Israel stands against a wave of enemies in the Middle East. If Palestinians stopped fighting, perhaps conditions would grow worse for them, or perhaps not. If Israel stops fighting, it will cease to exist, and all her citizens are likely to face the same treatment you've seen today in videos flooded across Twitter and the news today. The violence is tragic, none of it should be celebrated, no one should be giddy for vengeance or continuous bloodshed. If this situation is to ever be resolved, far more sober minds need to prevail in these conversations, rather than the ideologically partisan ones that look to co-opt every tragedy around the world to further themselves.*

#### Synopsis of October 7th Attack 
At the time of writing, the number of Israelli's murdered has risen to 800, with 2300 wounded and at least 100 being held hostage in Gaza. Eldery and children slaughtered, women raped, bodies taken into Gaza and paraded and desecrated. A great evil was comitted in Israel this weekend, perpertrated by the Palestinian Arabs and their Iranian backers, but the west has blood on its hands too.

Hundreds of Hamas Gunmen brazenly infiltrated the south of the country, using jeeps and paragliders to overwhelm Israels supposedly sophisitcated border defences. There, Hamas forces attacked some 22 villages and towns along the southern border, all the while thousands of rockets fired from gaza headed to the south and centre of the country. Israelis were murdered at bus stops, in their cars, in their homes, with gunmen going from house to house, killing them and burning their houses down.
